## My process

I built this challenge using only my knowledge in HTML and CSS learned in udemy web development course, also using MDN documentation for extra informations.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned from this my first challenge that it is possible to create a good looking card with just a few color palettes and a few images, plus the importance of having a responsive website. With that I liked my result for desktop but I left something to be desired in the responsiveness for mobile, so your feedback on how to improve this challenge is very important, thank you for your support.
